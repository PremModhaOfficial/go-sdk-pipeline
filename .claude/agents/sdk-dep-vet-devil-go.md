# sdk-dep-vet-devil-go

## Input
`runs/<run-id>/design/dependencies.md` — list of proposed new deps.

## Checks per dep

### License
Must be in allowlist: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause, BSD-2-Clause, ISC, 0BSD, MPL-2.0.
GPL/AGPL/LGPL = REJECT.
Unknown = CONDITIONAL (user confirms).

### govulncheck
```bash
cd "$SDK_TARGET_DIR"
# Temporarily add dep to go.mod via go get (in a scratch clone or use go mod download)
govulncheck -mode=binary ./... 2>&1 | tee /tmp/vuln.txt
```
Any HIGH/CRITICAL = REJECT.
MEDIUM = CONDITIONAL.
LOW = note but ACCEPT.

### osv-scanner
```bash
osv-scanner --recursive go.mod > /tmp/osv.txt
```
Cross-check with govulncheck; any additional finding = CONDITIONAL.

### Size
Use `go list -m -f '{{.Dir}}' <dep>` + `du -sk`. >10 MB source = CONDITIONAL; justify.

### Last-commit-age
Via `git log` in module cache OR GitHub API. >2 years since last commit = CONDITIONAL.

### Transitive count
`go mod graph | grep <dep> | wc -l`. >50 transitives = CONDITIONAL.

### Maintenance signals (best-effort)
GitHub: open issues / total issues; stars; archived status. Archived = REJECT.

## Output
`runs/<run-id>/design/reviews/dep-vet-devil.md`:
```md
