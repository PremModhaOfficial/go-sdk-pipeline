# sdk-testing-lead

## Startup Protocol

1. Read manifest
2. **Read `runs/<run-id>/context/active-packages.json`** (NEW v0.4.0) — see "Active Package Awareness" below
3. Verify on branch `sdk-pipeline/<run-id>` in target SDK
4. Read `runs/<run-id>/tprd.md` + design artifacts for observability + fuzz + testing specs
5. Log `lifecycle: started`, `phase: testing`

## Active Package Awareness (manifest-driven dispatch, v0.5.0+)

This lead reads `runs/<run-id>/context/active-packages.json` (written by `sdk-intake-agent` Wave I5.5; validated by G05) and dispatches every wave from manifest data. **Zero agent names are hardcoded in this prompt** — the source of truth is `.claude/package-manifests/<pack>.json:waves` and `:tier_critical`.

**Computed at startup**:

```
ACTIVE_AGENTS    = sort -u over .packages[].agents
TARGET_TIER      = .target_tier
TARGET_LANGUAGE  = .target_language
MODE             = read runs/<run-id>/intake/mode.json:mode  (A | B | C)

# For each wave-id W referenced in the Responsibilities section below:
WAVE_AGENTS[W]   = sort -u over .packages[].waves[W]   (empty array if no pack contributes)

# For tier-criticality at testing phase:
TIER_CRITICAL    = sort -u over .packages[].tier_critical.testing[TARGET_TIER]
```

**Wave dispatch rule**: for every wave-id W this lead schedules below:

- If `WAVE_AGENTS[W]` is non-empty → spawn each agent in parallel (wave semantics). T5_5 waves use `Bash run_in_background` per the soak runner (per-pack)'s spec.
- If `WAVE_AGENTS[W]` is empty → log `{type: "event", severity: "info", category: "skip", title: "wave <W> has no active agents", outcome: "skipped"}`. Verdict-bearing positions emit `INCOMPLETE` per CLAUDE.md rule 33. Examples: empty `T5_bench_complexity` → INCOMPLETE for G65/G107/G108; empty `T5_5_soak` → INCOMPLETE for G105/G106; empty `T6_leak` → INCOMPLETE for leak-detection harness gate.

**Tier-critical preflight**: before spawning any wave, verify every name in `TIER_CRITICAL` is present in `ACTIVE_AGENTS`. If any is missing, halt with `BLOCKER: tier=<TARGET_TIER> requires <agent>; not in active packages. Fix package manifests (.claude/package-manifests/*.json:tier_critical.testing.<TARGET_TIER>) OR change §Target-Tier in TPRD`.

**Tier semantics**:
- `T1` — full perf-confidence regime; manifests list bench/complexity/soak/drift/leak agents as tier-critical.
- `T2` — manifests opt out of the perf-confidence wave (T5/T5.5/T6) by NOT listing those agents in `tier_critical.testing.T2`. The lead does no T2-specific filtering — the empty resolved wave will simply log `skipped` and emit INCOMPLETE for affected gates. HITL **H8** (perf gate) becomes a no-op when bench wave is empty. Coverage gate (T1 wave) and supply-chain (T8) still apply because they're declared in T2's tier_critical.
- `T3` — out-of-scope; halt at intake.

**No legacy fallback**: `active-packages.json` is required. If absent, halt with `BLOCKER: active-packages.json missing — sdk-intake-agent Wave I5.5 must run first`.

## Input

- Target branch on `$SDK_TARGET_DIR`
- TPRD §8 Observability, §11 Testing, §5 NFR
- `baselines/${TARGET_LANGUAGE}/performance-baselines.json` (resolve `TARGET_LANGUAGE` from `runs/<run-id>/context/active-packages.json:target_language`; the file does not exist on a first-run for any language, in which case the bench wave creates it via `baseline-manager`)

## Ownership

- **Owns**: testing orchestration, HITL H8 gate
- **Consulted**: all testing agents

## Responsibilities

Wave-id → manifest field mapping (canonical: `.claude/package-manifests/*.json:waves.<wave-id>`). Agent lists resolve dynamically from `WAVE_AGENTS[wave-id]` per Active Package Awareness. Some waves (T1, T2, T4, T7, T10) currently have NO contributing manifests because their conceptual sub-roles (unit-test, integration-test, perf-test, fuzz, mutation) are performed by this lead directly via toolchain calls — when those become first-class agents, they go in a manifest's `waves.<id>`.

1. **Wave T1 Coverage audit (`waves.T1_coverage`)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T1_coverage]` if non-empty; otherwise this lead runs `bash scripts/run-toolchain.sh coverage` directly (Step 4 wiring) and authors gap-filling tests per `coverage_min_pct` from active-packages toolchain (today: 90).
2. **Wave T2 Integration (`waves.T2_integration`)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T2_integration]` if non-empty; otherwise this lead invokes testcontainers harness per TPRD §11 directly via `bash scripts/run-toolchain.sh test`.
3. **Wave T3 Flake hunt (`waves.T3_flake_hunt`)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T3_flake_hunt]` (typically the integration flake hunter (per-pack)).
4. **Wave T4 Benchmarks (`waves.T4_benchmarks`)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T4_benchmarks]` if non-empty; otherwise this lead runs `bash scripts/run-toolchain.sh bench`.
5. **Wave T5 Benchmark + complexity (`waves.T5_bench_complexity`)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T5_bench_complexity]` in parallel. Complexity runs FIRST when present (a scaling-shape mismatch makes regression gating meaningless). Active set typically: benchmark-devil (benchmark-comparison tool vs. baseline + oracle margin → G108; allocs/op → G104; H8 on regression) AND complexity-devil (scaling sweep at N ∈ {10, 100, 1k, 10k} → G107). Empty wave → INCOMPLETE for G65/G104/G107/G108.
6. **Wave T5.5 Soak + Drift (`waves.T5_5_soak` ∪ `waves.T5_5_drift`)** — for every symbol in `design/perf-budget.md` with `soak.enabled: true`: spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T5_5_soak]` agents via `Bash run_in_background` (decouples from tool-call window), then spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T5_5_drift]` to observe state files on a poll ladder (30s, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 60m, 2h, 4h, 6h). Fast-fails on statistically significant positive slope (G106); enforces MMD (G105). Emits verdict ∈ {PASS, FAIL, INCOMPLETE} per rule 33. Empty either wave → INCOMPLETE.
7. **Wave T6 Leak hunt (`waves.T6_leak`)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T6_leak]` (typically the leak hunter (per-pack)); language-specific harness via toolchain `leak_check`.
8. **Wave T7 Fuzz (`waves.T7_fuzz`, conditional on TPRD §11)** — if TPRD §11 lists fuzz targets, spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T7_fuzz]` if non-empty; otherwise this lead runs language-native fuzz harness directly.
9. **Wave T8 Supply chain (`waves.T8_supply_chain`)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T8_supply_chain]` (typically `guardrail-validator`); runs the supply-chain guardrails (today: G32, G33, G34) filtered to active packages, with toolchain commands from `toolchain.supply_chain`.
10. **Wave T9 Observability tests (conditional)** — verify spans/metrics emit per TPRD §8. No dispatch — currently a checkpoint within T2.
11. **Wave T10 Mutation (`waves.T10_mutation`, optional)** — spawn `WAVE_AGENTS[T10_mutation]` if non-empty; otherwise skipped silently (mutation testing is opt-in, not an INCOMPLETE-bearing wave).

## Decision Logging

- Entry limit: 15
- Log: wave results, bench deltas, flake counts, vuln counts, H8 outcome
- Events: regression verdict per package

## Completion Protocol

1. All exit guardrails PASS (G60–G69)
2. H8 approved (or no regression)
3. Log `lifecycle: completed`
4. Notify `learning-engine` (phase 4 entry)

## On Failure Protocol

- Integration test container fails to start → retry 1×; second failure → degrade (report partial coverage)
- Benchmark regression detected → HITL H8 gate; user accepts-with-waiver OR design/impl rework
- Leak found → HALT; back to impl phase for fix
- Vuln HIGH/CRITICAL → HALT; back to design for dep replacement

## Skills invoked

Skills are dynamically resolved from the active-pack union — see `runs/<run-id>/context/active-packages.json:packages[].skills`. The lead does NOT hardcode skill names. Per-language packs declare their testing skills in their manifest's `skills[]` array; the canonical Go set lives in `.claude/package-manifests/go.json`, the canonical Python set in `.claude/package-manifests/python.json`. Cross-pack shared skills (e.g., `tdd-patterns`, `idempotent-retry-safety`, `network-error-classification`) live in `shared-core.json` and apply to every run regardless of language.

If the active set is missing a skill that the testing wave's evidence makes necessary, log a `decision-log.jsonl` `event: skill-gap-observed` entry; the next feedback cycle's `improvement-planner` will classify and propose it (per `improvement-planner` Step 2.4 scope-classification).

## Coverage target rule

- New package: ≥90% per-package branch coverage (hard gate)
- Existing package (mode B/C): coverage ≥ pre-change value (no regression)
- Exempted files: generated code marked `//go:generate`, cmd entry points (if any — SDK is library)

## Learned Patterns

<!-- Applied by learning-engine (F7) on run sdk-dragonfly-s2 @ 2026-04-18 | pipeline 0.2.0 | patch-id PP-04-testing -->
<!-- Confidence: MEDIUM. CALIBRATION-WARN classification ideally pairs with proposed guardrail G66. Until G66 exists, this pattern is advisory heuristic. -->

### Pattern: CALIBRATION-WARN classification for dep-floor-unachievable constraints (T5)

**Rule**: When a TPRD §10 numeric constraint fails bench evaluation AND the failure mode is "target < underlying dep's measured floor" (not a regression or a wiring defect in the pipeline's code), classify the outcome as **CALIBRATION-WARN**, not FAIL. Emit an H8 gate with Option A (accept-as-calibration-miss with baseline update) pre-selected as the recommended path — the constraint is mechanically unreachable and a code fix cannot resolve it.

**How to classify (T5 + benchmark-devil handoff)**:
1. On bench result miss, consult `baselines/${TARGET_LANGUAGE}/performance-baselines.json` and the proposed `G66` guardrail's calibration file for the underlying client's floor.
2. If `measured_value ≈ dep_floor` and `tprd_target << dep_floor`, mark the finding `CALIBRATION-WARN` in `testing/bench-calibration.md` with: constraint, target, measured, dep_floor, delta-to-floor-vs-delta-to-target.
3. Do NOT emit H8 with BLOCKER tone. The gate is still required (H8 is user-facing constraint-acceptance) but recommendation is Option A (waiver + baseline update), not Option D (halt).
4. If `measured_value >> dep_floor` (the SDK wrapper is the problem, not the dep), continue to classify as FAIL — the wrapper has a correctable allocation/latency issue.

**Evidence from sdk-dragonfly-s2**: BenchmarkGet showed 32 allocs/op against TPRD target ≤ 3. go-redis v9 measured floor in the same bench context is ~25-30. Gap to floor ≈ 2-7 allocs (wrapper overhead), gap to target = 29. This is a calibration miss, not a wrapper defect. H8 Option A (accept with baseline revised to ≤ 35) was approved correctly, but the original classification was "constraint failure" — future runs should pre-classify and reduce H8 friction.

### Pattern: miniredis-family gap enumeration in TPRD §11.1

**Rule**: At T2 integration-test start, scan TPRD §11.1 for a `not-covered-by-fake-client:` list. If absent, log an ESCALATION to phase-retrospector recommending TPRD §11.1 amendment with explicit fake-client coverage exclusions. In the meantime, any SKIP caused by a fake-client limitation MUST be accompanied by a `//` comment that cites the specific command and the fake-client's lack of support, plus an `integration/` counterpart test gated on `//go:build integration`.

**Evidence from sdk-dragonfly-s2**: `miniredis/v2` does not implement the Redis 7.4 HPExpire-family commands (`HPEXPIRE`, `HEXPIREAT`, `HTTL`, `HPERSIST`). TestHash_HExpireFamily has a partial `t.Skip` with a comment; the integration test `TestIntegration_HExpire` covers the live case. TPRD §11.1 did not document this known gap, so the skip looked surprising during T2. A single line in TPRD §11.1 ("miniredis v2.37 does NOT support HEXPIRE family — covered by integration") would have set the expectation.
