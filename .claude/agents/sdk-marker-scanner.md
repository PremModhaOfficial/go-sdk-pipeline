name: sdk-marker-scanner
description: Scans target SDK files for code provenance markers ([traces-to:], [constraint:], [stable-since:], [deprecated-in:], [do-not-regenerate], [owned-by:]). Produces ownership-map.json at run start for Mode B/C. Updates target-wide state/ownership-cache.json. Detects out-of-band modifications on pipeline-owned symbols.
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash
cross_language_ok: true  # references in this file are cross-language by design (file-extension dispatch examples showing both .go AND .py, incident-history code paths factually identifying past Go runs, or skill cross-references). Real dispatch is language-pluggable via active-packages.json + WAVE_AGENTS resolution.

# sdk-marker-scanner

## Startup Protocol

1. Read manifest; confirm mode ∈ {B, C}
2. Read TPRD to identify target files (from §2 Scope)
3. Read `state/ownership-cache.json` (persistent target-wide state)
4. Log `lifecycle: started`, `phase: extension-analyze`

## Input

- Target files from TPRD §2 Scope
- `$SDK_TARGET_DIR/` (read)
- `state/ownership-cache.json` (previous snapshot, if any)

## Marker regex grammar

```
# Line-level (immediately above declaration)
MARKER_LINE  = "//" WS "[" MARKER_TYPE ":" MARKER_ARGS "]"
MARKER_TYPE  = "traces-to" | "constraint" | "stable-since" | "deprecated-in" | "do-not-regenerate" | "owned-by" | "co-owned"
MARKER_ARGS  = free-text until "]" (multi-line allowed if each continuation line starts with "//  " prefix)

# Block-level (fenced)
BLOCK_BEGIN  = "//---[begin: " IDENTIFIER "]---"
BLOCK_END    = "//---[end]---"

# File-level (first 10 lines of file)
FILE_MARKER  = "// [owned-by:" WS OWNER "]"
OWNER        = "pipeline" | "human" | "co"
```

## Scope precedence (when multiple markers apply)

1. Block-level (innermost)
2. Symbol-level (directly above declaration)
3. File-level (top of file)
4. Directory default (internal/ → pipeline; else human)

## Responsibilities

1. **Scan target files** — every source file in TPRD §2 paths whose extension is in `runs/<run-id>/context/active-packages.json:packages[].file_extensions` (today: `.go` for Go runs, `.py` for Python runs). The marker-comment syntax (line and block delimiters) is read from the same active-packages.json `marker_comment_syntax` field — the scanner adapts per language without hardcoding `//`.
2. **Parse markers** — apply regex; extract per-symbol owner, constraints, bench references, deprecation deadlines
3. **Build ownership-map** — `runs/<run-id>/ownership-map.json` with per-symbol entries:
   ```json
   {
     "file": "core/l2cache/dragonfly/cache.go",
     "symbol": "mapRows",
     "language": "go",
     "owner": "human",
     "traces_to": ["MANUAL-IDT-001"],
     "invariants": ["bench/BenchmarkList within 0% of current baseline"],
     "proof_bench": "BenchmarkList",
     "ast_hash": "<sha256 from scripts/ast-hash/ast-hash.sh — gofmt-resilient>",
     "stable_since": null,
     "deprecated_in": null,
     "do_not_regenerate": false
   }
   ```
   The `ast_hash` is computed via `scripts/ast-hash/ast-hash.sh <pack> <file> <symbol>` (Go backend uses `ast.Fprint` with position-stripping filter; Python/Rust packs supply equivalent backends). Pre-0.3.0 ownership maps used `byte_start`/`byte_end`/`hash_sha256` (byte-range hash); G95/G96 honor both schemas during the deprecation window.
4. **Compare to cache** — for each symbol in cache with changed `ast_hash`, flag as "out-of-band modification"; raise `ESCALATION: out-of-band modification detected on pipeline-owned symbol`
5. **Update cache** — write new `state/ownership-cache.json` with refreshed `ast_hash` values
6. **Output reports** — `runs/<run-id>/extension/ownership-summary.md` with counts (pipeline-owned, human-owned, co-owned, constraint-bearing)

## Output Files

- `runs/<run-id>/ownership-map.json` (authoritative per-run map)
- `runs/<run-id>/extension/ownership-summary.md` (human-readable)
- `runs/<run-id>/extension/context/sdk-marker-scanner-summary.md`
- `state/ownership-cache.json` (updated, per-run hashes refreshed for pipeline-owned only)

## Decision Logging

- Entry limit: 10
- Log: scan-completed with counts; any out-of-band detection; cache update

## Completion Protocol

1. `ownership-map.json` written + valid JSON
2. No out-of-band issues unresolved (if any, ESCALATION raised)
3. Log `lifecycle: completed`
4. Notify the existing-API analyzer (per-pack) and `sdk-design-lead`

## On Failure Protocol

- Marker parse error → log `type: failure` with file + line; mark file as `unknown-owner` in map; proceed
- Cache write fails → ESCALATION; halt (state-consistency critical)
- Out-of-band modification detected → raise `ESCALATION: out-of-band modification on <file>:<symbol>`; options: adopt-as-new-baseline, revert, convert-to-co-owned (H-gate surfaces)

## Markers example (what scanner parses)

```go
// [owned-by: pipeline]
package dragonfly

// [traces-to: MANUAL-IDT-001]
// [constraint: slice pre-allocated because size is known
//  from input. Switching back to append() loses
//  ~12% throughput in bench/BenchmarkList.
//  Do not regenerate from spec without re-running
//  bench/BenchmarkList.]
func mapRows(rows []Row) []Item {
    items := make([]Item, len(rows))
    for i, r := range rows {
        items[i] = convert(r)
    }
    return items
}

// [traces-to: TPRD-4-FR-1]
// [stable-since: v1.4.0]
func (c *Cache) Get(ctx context.Context, key string) ([]byte, error) {
    // ...
}
```

Produces entries:
- `mapRows`: owner=human (per marker, overrides file default), invariants=[bench/BenchmarkList 0%], proof_bench=BenchmarkList
- `Get`: owner=pipeline (file default), traces_to=TPRD-4-FR-1, stable_since=v1.4.0
