# Review-Fix Resolution Protocol

## Overview

Every pipeline phase follows the same review-fix resolution loop after review agents produce findings. The loop tracks each issue individually (max 5 retries per issue), routes fixes to the correct agent, deduplicates across reviewers, and detects when the loop is stuck.

## Structured Findings JSON Schema

Every review agent MUST produce a `.findings.json` file alongside their markdown report. This is the machine-readable input for the resolution loop.

### Findings File Schema

```json
{
  "reviewer": "<agent-name>",
  "phase": "<phase-name>",
  "run_id": "<uuid>",
  "iteration": 1,
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601>",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "<PHASE-PREFIX>-<NNN>",
      "severity": "blocker|high|medium|low",
      "category": "<category>",
      "title": "<short description>",
      "description": "<detailed explanation>",
      "file": "<file-path>",
      "line": "<line-number or null>",
      "fix_agent": "<agent-name that should fix this>",
      "fix_action": "<specific action to take>",
      "story_id": "<US-XXX if traceable, else null>"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 0,
    "blocker": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0
  }
}
```

### Finding ID Prefixes by Phase

| Phase | Prefix | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Architecture | `AR` | `AR-001` |
| Detailed Design | `DD` | `DD-001` |
| Implementation | `IM` | `IM-001` |
| Testing | `TS` | `TS-001` |
| Frontend | `FE` | `FE-001` |

### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition | Resolution Requirement |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| `blocker` | Prevents the phase from being signed off | MUST fix — blocks report approval |
| `high` | Significant quality issue | SHOULD fix — degrades quality if left |
| `medium` | Improvement opportunity | FIX if possible within iteration budget |
| `low` | Minor suggestion | FIX only if trivial, else log as accepted |

## Deterministic-First Gate (v1.1.0)

### Why

Rule 13 (Post-Iteration Review Re-Run) requires the full reviewer fleet on every rework iteration. The fleet is expensive: 5+ devil agents × full-artifact input × per-agent decision-log writes. Running the fleet on code that hasn't even passed `go build` / `go vet` / `goleak` wastes tokens — reviewer findings on broken code are dominated by the mechanical breakage and get superseded on the next iteration anyway.

The gate preserves Rule 13's correctness invariant: **every iteration whose output a reviewer would meaningfully evaluate still gets reviewed.** What it removes is reviewer-fleet spawn cost for iterations we already know are going to need another fix pass.

### What counts as "deterministic"

BLOCKER checks that are 100% script-driven and produce PASS/FAIL without LLM judgment. In this pipeline:

- `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `gofmt -l`, `staticcheck ./...`
- `go test ./... -race -count=1`
- `goleak.VerifyTestMain` (G51)
- `govulncheck` / `osv-scanner` (supply-chain, G32–G34)
- Marker hygiene byte-hash checks (G95, G96, G98, G100, G103)
- Constraint-bench proofs (G97) — deterministic given pinned seeds
- License allowlist check (dep-vet, G33)

WARNING-severity guardrail failures do NOT trigger the gate — reviewer fleet proceeds.

### Gate behavior

1. After every fix batch, run the guardrail script fleet (cheap, parallel).
2. If any BLOCKER fails: synthesize the failures into the findings schema (fix_agent = the agent that owns the failing domain per the phase's fix-agent map), merge into `issue_tracker`, and loop back to fix-agent routing. **Do not spawn the reviewer fleet this iteration.**
3. If no BLOCKER fails: proceed to reviewer fleet re-run (current behavior).

Guardrail findings get IDs prefixed `GR-<Gxx>-<iter>` so they're distinguishable from reviewer findings in the issue tracker and report.

### What the gate does NOT change

- Full-fleet reviewer re-run still happens on every iteration that reaches 3g.
- Per-issue retry cap (5), stuck detection (2), global iteration cap (10) apply unchanged — including to synthesized guardrail findings.
- Final-wave reviewer fleet before phase sign-off runs regardless (exit-gate reviewer run is not a rework iteration).

### Observed cost shape

Reviewer-fleet spawn per iteration ≈ N_reviewers × avg_reviewer_tokens. Gate saves this cost on any iteration whose fix batch introduced a mechanical regression. In runs where the mechanical guardrails typically flag 30–40% of iterations, gate saves ~30–40% of the reviewer-fleet token spend at zero correctness loss.

## Deduplication Logic

Multiple reviewers may flag the same issue. Before routing to fix agents:

1. **Group findings by `file` + approximate `title` match** (case-insensitive, ignoring articles)
2. **If two findings target the same file and describe the same issue**:
   - Keep the one with **HIGHER severity**
   - Discard the duplicate
   - Log: `"Deduplicated: {id-kept} supersedes {id-discarded}"`
3. **Cross-reviewer deduplication**: If `frontend-code-reviewer` flags "Missing error boundary" and `simulated-frontend-lead` flags "Add Error Boundary" for the same file, keep the higher severity one

## Fix Agent Routing

Each finding's `fix_agent` field determines who fixes it. The phase lead spawns fix agents with this exact format:

```
RESOLUTION FIX — Iteration {N}

You are being called to fix specific review findings. Do NOT run your normal generation flow.

FINDINGS TO FIX:
1. {id} ({severity}): {title}
   File: {file}:{line}
   Description: {description}
   Action: {fix_action}
   Retry: {retry_count}/{per_issue_max_retries}

RULES:
- Read ONLY the files listed above
- Fix ONLY the issues described
- Do NOT regenerate files from scratch
- Do NOT modify unrelated code
- Verify fix compiles/passes
- Log a "type":"refactor" entry per finding to the decision log
```

## Manifest Tracking Schema

Every phase lead tracks the resolution loop in the run manifest:

```json
{
  "resolution_loop": {
    "status": "pending|in-progress|completed|stuck|converged_with_ignored",
    "current_iteration": 0,
    "max_global_iterations": 10,
    "per_issue_max_retries": 5,
    "stuck_threshold": 2,
    "issue_tracker": {
      "<finding-id>": {
        "severity": "blocker",
        "title": "...",
        "fix_agent": "...",
        "retry_count": 0,
        "status": "open|fixed|ignored",
        "ignored_reason": null
      }
    },
    "history": [
      {
        "iteration": 1,
        "open": 15,
        "fixed": 0,
        "ignored": 0,
        "new": 0
      }
    ],
    "final_summary": {
      "total_found": 0,
      "resolved": 0,
      "ignored_after_max_retries": 0,
      "ignored_stuck": 0,
      "open": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Convergence Criteria

The loop terminates when ANY of these conditions is met:

| Condition | Status | Report Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| All findings resolved | `completed` | APPROVE |
| All remaining are `ignored` (max retries) | `converged_with_ignored` | APPROVE_WITH_CAVEATS (list ignored) |
| Stuck for 2 consecutive iterations | `stuck` | NOT_READY (if blockers remain) |
| Global iteration cap (10) reached | `max_iterations_reached` | NOT_READY |

## Report Integration

Every phase's final report MUST include a **Resolution Loop Summary** section:

```markdown
## Resolution Loop Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total findings | 23 |
| Resolved | 20 |
| Ignored (max retries) | 2 |
| Ignored (stuck) | 1 |
| Iterations | 4 |
| Status | CONVERGED_WITH_IGNORED |

### Ignored Issues (accepted risk)
1. AR-007 (medium): "Missing retry logic in NATS publisher" — 5 fix attempts, pattern-advisor unable to resolve
2. AR-015 (low): "Cost estimate missing for Redis cluster" — stuck after 3 iterations

### Resolution History
| Iteration | Open | Fixed | Ignored | New |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|-----|
| 1 | 23 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 15 | 8 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 9 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 1 |
```

## Review Agent Requirements

For this protocol to work, ALL review agents across ALL phases MUST:

1. Produce a `.findings.json` alongside their markdown report
2. Include `fix_agent` field on every finding
3. Include `severity` field on every finding
4. Use the standard finding ID prefix for their phase
5. On re-run iterations, compare with previous findings to identify resolved vs. new
